# 🌸 Iris Species Prediction GUI

This is a simple desktop application that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements. The model is trained using the classic Iris dataset and deployed using a PyQt5-based GUI.

> 🚀 This project is developed as part of the **Intel® Unnati** course on AI and Machine Learning.
